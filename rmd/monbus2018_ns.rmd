# Touring

- Linear dimensionality reduction, embedding a $p$-dim data object into a $d$-dim subspace, where:
-- $p$, dimensions (numeric variables) of the data, $x$ exsists in $R^p$
-- $d$, dimensions of the subset embedding, $d < p, R^d$ exsists in $R^p$
-- embeddings are [orthgonal projections (linear algebra)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projection_(linear_algebra)#Orthogonal_projections)
- Let $d$ = 2
-- The linear combinations of the variables give us an orientation to project down to 2 dimensions
-- Replcate this process for many 2-dimensional embeddings, making small changes to the linear combinations of variables
-- Plot the embeddings gives an animation as the data rotates in $p$-space

# Analogy - shadow puppets

- Suppose a bar stool is suspended in front of a light source such that only a ciclular shadow is projected.
- If the stool is rotated, the 3-dimensional shape is quickly revealed to the observer
- This

# Questions
- 1) Do posts have weekly trends?
- 2) Can we predict the number of comments a post will receive?
- 3) What do comments look like?
- 4) Can we predict the score of a comment?

---
# 1) Do posts have weekly trends?

- Admittedly unweighted by count of wday (Sunday and Monday get a freebie)
- More recent comments at a slight disadvantage, comments may not have run their course.
```{r, echo=FALSE}

```

---
# Prep for modeling

```{r, fig.height=5}

```
- 2 right skewed variables
- Thin density peak of num_comments; take a look at this

---
# num_comment density

```{r, echo=FALSE}

```

- In good company at 0, mean = 5, >70% at 10 comments
- It looks like the 0 comment posts are almost uniquely is_OC = FALSE, will comment on this later

---
# 2) Can we predict the number of comments a post will receive?

- model1:   $num\_comments =  X_0 + X_1*title\_len + X_2*daysold, x_3*is\_OC$
- Adj. r^2 is only .0054! Huge outlier, the 7k point.
- Why the "columns"? is_OC only has 2 values! coefficient(is_OC) = 70.6, seems generous considering quantiles
- Fanning residuals, right skewed var; what did we learn in Assignment 3? Log right skewed variables!

```{r, echo = FALSE}

```

---
# 2) Can we predict the number of comments a post will receive?

- Best linear model:   $log(num\_comments) =  X_0 + X_1*is\_OC$
- Ended up removing daysold and log(title_len) (giving a slight boost to adj r^2)
- adj r^2 = .161. gained over 29x, by logging num_comments! (Only 13x gain if we had removed the 7k point)
- Interpretation: "The presence (or absence) of self tagging 'OC' can explain 16.1% of the variation of (log) number of comments"!

```{r, echo = FALSE}


```

# Comment data 

- Comment data about 1 April 2018 post to /r/DataIsBeautiful
- Pulled via *RedditExtractoR* package, Reddit API (09 May 2018)
- 495 observations, 22 columns after cleaning. API Limit: 500 comments
- First look at a simpler example
- Note structure, comment variables

```{r, echo=FALSE}

```

---
# 3) What do comments look like?

- This is only 33 comments, get prohibitively busy quickly
- Would be interesting to see user networks

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=6}

```

---
# Clean data, subset

- Cleaning: fix data types, extract variables.
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=5}

```
- Will log comment_score and comment_len right away
- Only comments from the first 2 days

---
# 4) Can we predict the score of a comment?

- Best linear model:   $log(comments\_score) =  X_0 + X_1*postdaysold$
- Only 1 variable again, though intercept is highly significant here
- Negative slope; comment early for a higher score
- adj r^2 = .224
- (Log) comment_score is best described by a variable that is limited by the API.
- Interpretation: "Commenting on the first (vs second) day of a post can explain 22.4% of the variation of the (log) score of the comment"

```{r, echo=FALSE}

```

---
# Summary
- 1) Do posts have weekly trends?
    - Weekends, Wednesday have the least posts, OC posts might be more resistant
- 2) Can we predict the number of comments a post will receive?
    - The presence (or absence) of self tagging 'OC' can explain 16.1% of the variation in (log) number of comments.
- 3) What do comments look like?
    - We can visualize them in a tree structure
- 4) Can we predict the score of a comment?
    - Commenting on the first (vs second) day of a post can explain 22.4% of the variation of the (log) score of the comment.

---
# Going further

- Text analysis of post titles, comments
- Network of comments
- Joins
    - Join comments$post_score back to links.
    - self-join the number of times each user comments on the post.
- cross sectional study to a more popular subreddit (can we get away from 0 comments/ 0 scores?)
- Obviuous API limitations
    - Timestamps
    - comments >= 2 post days old 
    - max links = 1000
    - max comments = 500
- validations of API calls (is there bias on old and new posts/comments?)
